# ABC_Call_Volume_Trend_Analysis :-

## Introduction :

· This project diving into the world of Customer Experience (CX) analytics, specifically focusing on the inbound calling team of a company. 

· The company have provided a dataset that spans 23 days and includes various details such as the agent's name and ID, the queue time (how long a customer had to wait before connecting with an agent), the time of the call, the duration of the call, and the call status (whether it was abandoned, answered, or transferred).

· A Customer Experience (CX) team plays a crucial role in a company. They analyze customer feedback and data, derive insights from it, and share these insights with the rest of the organization.

· In this project lead us to apply our analytical skills to understand the trends in the call volume of the CX team and derive valuable insights from it.

## Apporach :

· Handle Missing Values: Identify and address missing values through imputation, removal, or other techniques.

· Remove Duplicates: Identify and eliminate duplicate records if necessary.

· Correct Errors: Fix inaccuracies or inconsistencies in the data.

· Standardize Formats: Ensure that data formats are consistent (e.g., date formats, text casing).

## Tools & Technologies Used :

· Microsoft Excel (2019) & it's functions and forumulas.

## KPI's :

### 1) Average Call Duration:

· Showcased the average duration of all incoming calls received by agents according to different time buckets.

· Visualised the result using a vertical bar plot.

· We could see that the average call duration is high during 16.00-17.00

### 2) Call Volume Analysis:

· This KPI shows the no. of calls received and their status for different time buckets which helps us to understand the customers wish time of they making the calls.

· Visualised the result using a stacked column chart.

· From these result we could see that high number of calls were receied during 11.00-12.00.

### 3) Manpower Planning:

· The current rate of abandoned calls is approximately 30%, hence this KPI helps in identifying the requried number of agents for different time buckets during (09.00-21.00) so that the abandoned calls rate shall reduce to 10%.

· Showcased the present manpower count and required manpower count to reduce the abandoned call rate using a line chart.

· We could see that the current no. of staff availability during 19.00-21.00 is seems high according the average of calls received and its duration and in the same case, the current manpower is less during 09.00-15.00 considering the received calls and its duration.

### 4) Night Shift Manpower Planning:

· Customers also call ABC Insurance Company at night but don't get an answer because there are no agents available which may create poor customer experience.

· This KPI helps the company to put sufficient number of staffs during 21.00-09.00 to ensures the calls are answered during night time as well.

· Considering the average calls received and average call duration during 09.00-21.00 for different time buckets, proposed required no. of staffs during 21.00-09.00 (Note: Assumed that for every 100 calls that customers make between 9 am and 9 pm, they also make 30 calls at night between 9 pm and 9 am).

## Conclusion :

· While the overall call response metrics are within acceptable ranges, there is potential for more effective resource utilization. Analyzing call patterns and adjusting manpower allocation accordingly could further optimize our service delivery and reduce operational costs.

· Data shows that call volumes peak during specific times of the day. To improve customer satisfaction and reduce wait times, we recommend adjusting staffing levels or introducing flexible shift patterns to better align with peak periods.
